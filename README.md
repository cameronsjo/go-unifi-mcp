# go-unifi-mcp

> **Fork of [claytono/go-unifi-mcp](https://github.com/claytono/go-unifi-mcp)**
> with enhanced tool discoverability and fork-specific distribution.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for UniFi Network Controller, written in
Go.

## Fork Enhancements

This fork adds the following on top of upstream:

- **Filterable enum hints** — List tool descriptions now surface which fields
  support enum filtering and their valid values (e.g.,
  `Filterable enums: purpose (corporate|guest|wan)`), making it easier for LLMs
  to construct targeted queries without trial and error
- **Homebrew tap** — Install via `brew install cameronsjo/tap/go-unifi-mcp`
- **Docker images** — Published to `ghcr.io/cameronsjo/go-unifi-mcp`
- **CI fixes** — Removed broken `python-kacl` pre-commit hook (incompatible with
  Python 3.13)

## Overview

`go-unifi-mcp` provides an MCP interface to UniFi Network Controller, enabling
AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with your UniFi infrastructure.

### Why this exists

I couldn’t find an MCP server that supported both v1 and v2 firewall rules and
IPv6, so I built one. This wraps the go-unifi library (which I trust from my
Terraform provider experience) and leans on its generated API surface. The
server is generated from the controller’s own API definitions, which makes it
much easier to keep tool coverage up to date as UniFi evolves.

### UniFi controller versioning

This project generates tools against the same UniFi Controller version pinned by
go-unifi. When go-unifi updates its supported controller version, we regenerate
our field definitions and tool metadata to match. We support the same controller
range; see their
[controller support range](https://github.com/filipowm/go-unifi/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-unifi-controller-versions).

## Configuration

### UniFi Credentials

The server requires access to a UniFi Network Controller. Two authentication
methods are supported:

1. **API Key** (preferred): Create an API key in your UniFi controller under
   Settings > Control Plane > Integrations. Set `UNIFI_HOST` and
   `UNIFI_API_KEY`.

2. **Username/Password**: Use a local admin account. Set `UNIFI_HOST`,
   `UNIFI_USERNAME`, and `UNIFI_PASSWORD`.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**Using the binary:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/go-unifi-mcp",
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_HOST": "https://your-controller:443",
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unifi": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "UNIFI_HOST",
        "-e",
        "UNIFI_API_KEY",
        "ghcr.io/cameronsjo/go-unifi-mcp:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "UNIFI_HOST": "https://your-controller:443",
        "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add unifi -- go-unifi-mcp
```

Then set the required environment variables in your shell before running
`claude`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable           | Required | Default   | Description                     |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `UNIFI_HOST`       | Yes      | —         | UniFi controller URL            |
| `UNIFI_API_KEY`    | \*       | —         | API key (preferred auth method) |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME`   | \*       | —         | Username for password auth      |
| `UNIFI_PASSWORD`   | \*       | —         | Password for password auth      |
| `UNIFI_SITE`       | No       | `default` | UniFi site name                 |
| `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL` | No       | `true`    | Whether to verify SSL certs     |
| `UNIFI_LOG_LEVEL`  | No       | `error`   | go-unifi client log level       |
| `UNIFI_TOOL_MODE`  | No       | `lazy`    | Tool registration mode          |

\* Either `UNIFI_API_KEY` or both `UNIFI_USERNAME` and `UNIFI_PASSWORD` must be
set.

### Log Levels

The `UNIFI_LOG_LEVEL` variable controls logging from the underlying go-unifi
client library. The default is `error` because the client otherwise emits INFO
messages to stderr, which can interfere with tools like mcp-cli that parse JSON
on stdout/stderr.

| Level      | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `disabled` | No logging                           |
| `trace`    | Most verbose, including wire details |
| `debug`    | Debug messages                       |
| `info`     | Informational messages               |
| `warn`     | Warnings only                        |
| `error`    | Errors only (default)                |

### Tool Modes

The server supports two tool registration modes, following the pattern
established by
[unifi-network-mcp](https://github.com/sirkirby/unifi-network-mcp):

| Mode    | Tools | Context Size | Description                                     |
| ------- | ----- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `lazy`  | 3     | ~200 tokens  | Meta-tools only (default, recommended for LLMs) |
| `eager` | 242   | ~55K tokens  | All tools registered directly                   |

**Lazy mode** (default) registers only 3 meta-tools that provide access to 242
UniFi operations (generated from the controller API):

- `tool_index` - Search/filter the tool catalog by category or resource
- `execute` - Execute any tool by name with arguments
- `batch` - Execute multiple tools in parallel

This dramatically reduces context window usage while preserving full
functionality. The LLM first queries the index to find relevant tools, then
executes them via the dispatcher.

**Eager mode** registers all 242 tools directly, which may be useful for non-LLM
clients or debugging but consumes significant context.

**Update semantics:** Updates use a read-modify-write flow against the
controller API. We fetch the current resource, merge your fields, and submit the
full object. This avoids clearing unspecified fields, but it is not atomic and
concurrent updates can race (last write wins) because the UniFi API does not
expose etags or revision IDs. In practice this is unlikely to be an issue, but
it's something to be aware of.

### ID Resolution

Responses from the UniFi API contain opaque ID references (e.g. `network_id`,
`usergroup_id`, `networkconf_id`). By default, the server resolves these to
human-readable names by looking up the referenced resource and injecting a
sibling `_name` field:

```json
{
  "src_networkconf_id": "609fbf24e3ae433962e000de",
  "src_networkconf_name": "IOT"
}
```

Resolution uses a per-request cache, so listing 100 firewall rules that
reference networks only makes one additional `ListNetwork` API call. Typical
overhead is 10-40ms depending on how many distinct resource types are
referenced.

To disable resolution for a specific call, pass `"resolve": false` in the tool
arguments.

### Query Parameters

All list operations support optional post-processing parameters for filtering
and projecting results.

**filter** — Match items by field values. Supports three operators:

```jsonc
// Exact match
{"filter": {"type": "usw"}}

// Substring match (case-insensitive)
{"filter": {"name": {"contains": "office"}}}

// Regular expression (RE2 syntax: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
{"filter": {"name": {"regex": "^ap-.*"}}}

// Multiple conditions (ANDed together)
{"filter": {"type": "uap", "name": {"contains": "echo"}}}
```

**search** — Case-insensitive full-text search across all string field values:

```json
{ "search": "living room" }
```

**fields** — Project the response to include only specific keys:

```json
{ "fields": ["name", "ip", "mac"] }
```

Parameters can be combined. Execution order is filter → search → fields, so you
can filter on fields that are excluded from the output:

```json
{
  "filter": { "type": "uap" },
  "search": "echo",
  "fields": ["name", "ip"]
}
```

## Development

git clone https://github.com/cameronsjo/go-unifi-mcp.git
cd go-unifi-mcp

# Enter the development environment
nix develop
# Or with direnv:
direnv allow

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run linters
task lint

# Run tests
task test

# Run tests with coverage
task coverage
```

### Available Tasks

```bash
task lint        # Run linters via pre-commit
task test        # Run tests
task coverage    # Run tests with coverage checks
task build       # Build the binary
task generate    # Run go generate
```

### Testing with mcp-cli

The development environment includes
[mcp-cli](https://github.com/philschmid/mcp-cli) for interactive testing of the
MCP server.

1. Create `.envrc.local` with your UniFi credentials (not tracked in git):

   ```bash
   export UNIFI_HOST="https://your-controller:443"
   export UNIFI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   # Or use username/password:
   # export UNIFI_USERNAME="admin"
   # export UNIFI_PASSWORD="password"
   ```

2. Build the binary:

   ```bash
   task build
   ```

3. Test with mcp-cli:

   The `.mcp_servers.json` config provides two server entries:
   - `go-unifi-mcp` - eager mode (242 tools)
   - `go-unifi-mcp-lazy` - lazy mode (3 meta-tools)

   **Eager mode** (direct tool access):

   ```bash
   # List tools (shows all 242)
   mcp-cli info go-unifi-mcp

   # Call a tool directly
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp list_device '{}'
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp list_network '{"site": "default"}'
   ```

   **Lazy mode** (meta-tools):

   ```bash
   # List tools (shows only 3 meta-tools)
   mcp-cli info go-unifi-mcp-lazy

   # Query the tool index
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp-lazy tool_index '{}'
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp-lazy tool_index '{"category": "list"}'
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp-lazy tool_index '{"resource": "network"}'

   # Execute a tool via the dispatcher
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp-lazy execute '{"tool": "list_device", "arguments": {}}'

   # Batch execute multiple tools
   mcp-cli call go-unifi-mcp-lazy batch '{"calls": [{"tool": "list_network", "arguments": {}}, {"tool": "list_device", "arguments": {}}]}'
   ```
